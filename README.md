### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ“Š I'm currently working as an Analyst for the Tender Business Intelligence Deparment of Roche Diagnostics Spain.
- ðŸ‘½ I'm looking to collaborate in a project where I can make a wider use of my coding skills. 
- ðŸ‘‰ I'll be uploading some of my bootcamp projects during the next weeks, as well as, some new projects I'm planning to work on just for fun	ðŸŽŠ 
- ðŸŒ± I'm a nature lover which finds impossible to choose between beach and mountain. Still, love my beautiful Barcelona, which is with no doubt the best city in the world.
